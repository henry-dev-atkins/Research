Personal Research

This is some research I have conducted. Some will be out of date by the time you read them, and if you have any queries let me know via my LinkedIn. 

1) Research on technical analysis (asking whether it works) via Hammer-Candlesticks and Market-Gaps.
2) Etsy. Fundimental and technical rundown.
3) Correlations and Indicator developments.
